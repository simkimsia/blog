### Open Your Terminal

We recommend using **VS Code** or **Antigravity** as your development environment — both have built-in terminals.

=== "VS Code (Recommended)"

    **1. Install VS Code** (if you haven't already)

    [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" }

    **2. Open the Terminal**

    1. Open VS Code
    2. Press `` Ctrl+` `` (Windows) or `` Cmd+` `` (macOS) to open the integrated terminal. An alternative is inside VS Code (top menu) > **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.

    ??? tip "Where is the Backtick (`) key?"
        It is usually located above the **Tab** key and below **Esc**.

    !!! tip "Why VS Code?"
        You'll be editing code anyway — having the terminal in the same window is convenient.

    !!! tip "How to close the terminal in VS Code?"
        Sometimes, you need to restart the terminal. You can do this by pressing the trash can icon in the top right corner of the terminal.

=== "Antigravity"

    **1. Install Antigravity** (if you haven't already)

    [Download Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/download){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" }

    2. Press `` Ctrl+` `` (Windows) or `` Cmd+` `` (macOS) to open the integrated terminal. An alternative is inside Antigravity (top menu) > **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
