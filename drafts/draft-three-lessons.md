# The Art of the Counter-Intuitive Lens: 3 Lessons from Physical Skills

I’ve always found that the most profound insights come from the visceral experience of learning a physical skill. But lately, I’ve realized there’s a common thread running through the shooting range, the slopes, and the trail.

They all require **counter-intuitive adjustments** in how you pay attention.

To hit the target, sometimes you have to look away from it. To stay upright, you have to look at what's right in front of you instead of the horizon. Here are three lessons on how I’m adjusting my lens in business.

## 1. Aim Off: The Deliberate Inaccuracy

During my National Service in the Army, I learned about "Aiming Off."

If the wind is blowing from the left, or if your rifle consistently pulls slightly to the right, you don't aim at the bullseye. You intentionally aim "off" to the side—deliberately being inaccurate—so that the external forces carry your bullet exactly where it needs to go.

### The Application: Compensating for Delivery-Bias
I have a natural "delivery-bias." My brain is wired to look 5-10 meters ahead, worrying about implementation, complexity, and whether I can actually deliver the value.

Because of this, if I aim at "the bullseye" (a balanced business), I will always miss. My delivery-bias will pull me toward over-engineering and hesitation, and I'll end up with no sales.

To hit the mark, I have to **Aim Off**. I have to intentionally aim "too far" toward Sales and Pitching. It feels "wrong" and "inaccurate" to my delivery-focused brain, but by aiming off, I allow my natural tendencies to pull the result back into the center: a business that actually has work to deliver.

## 2. Near-Focus: The 2-Meter Horizon

While snowboarding in Japan, I kept falling because I was looking 5-10 meters ahead. I was terrified of the steepness and the obstacles, frozen in a "deer in headlights" state.

The fix was counter-intuitive: **Focus on the immediate 1-2 meters ahead of you.**

By shortening my horizon, the mountain became manageable. I wasn't fighting the whole slope; I was just navigating the next two meters.

### The Application: Daily Shine vs. Daily Offer
In business, we are told to have a "vision" (looking 10 meters ahead). But for me, that vision often leads to paralysis.

"Near-Focus" means tracking two short-term metrics every single day:
- **Daily Shine**: Exporting value to the world (a post, a video, a Loom).
- **Daily Offer**: Making a pitch.

I used to worry about whether I could deliver a complex solution (a 10-meter problem). But the **SBLV Case** taught me that if you solve a real, rare pain point, people are willing to wait. The bottleneck isn't the 10-meter delivery; it's the 1-meter offer. By paying attention to the immediate 1-2 meters, I stay upright and keep moving.

## 3. Look at the Gap: The Space Between Trees

In skiing or mountain biking, there’s a golden rule: **Don't look at the trees. Look at the space between the trees.**

If you focus on the tree you’re trying to avoid, your body will naturally steer you right into it. To navigate a crowded forest, you have to ignore the obstacles and focus entirely on the "gap"—the empty space where you want to be.

### The Application: Ignoring the Competition
In business, the "trees" are the competition, the market saturation, and the reasons why a project might fail. It’s counter-intuitive to ignore them, but if you focus on the "trees," you’ll end up paralyzed by them.

Instead, I’m learning to look at the **Gap**: the specific, underserved pain point that no one else is hitting. By focusing on the "empty space" (the unique value I can provide), I naturally navigate through the crowded forest of the market without hitting an obstacle.

## Synthesis: Adjusting the Lens

These lessons are all counter-intuitive:
1. **Aim Off**: Be "inaccurate" to be precise.
2. **Near-Focus**: Look "short" to go long.
3. **Look at the Gap**: Ignore the "trees" to find the path.

In the end, success isn't just about working harder; it's about knowing when the way you're currently seeing the world is the very thing keeping you from hitting the target.
