# My Year of Tool Hopping: A 2025 Retrospective

If there is one lesson I learned in 2025, it's that loyalty to a specific AI tool is a liability. The landscape changes too fast.

Here is what my actual usage looked like this year:

* **Early 2025:** Started with **Cursor** using Claude models.
* **Feb 2025:** Committed to a 1-year **Claude Pro** subscription.
* **March 2025:** Switched my Cursor config to **Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
* **May 2025:** moved back to Claude on Cursor when **Claude 4.0** dropped.
* **June 2025:** The Cursor experience started feeling sluggish and buggy. I dropped it and moved to **Claude Code** (the CLI).
* **July 2025:** Brief experiment with **Gemini CLI**, but stuck with Claude Code.
* **September 2025:** Tried **Codex**. I found OpenAI models handled TypeScript better than Claude, but after my 2-month free access ended, I went back to Claude Code.
* **Late Sept 2025:** **Sonnet 4.5** released. I became a heavy Claude Code user again.
* **Mid-Year:** Experimented with **mgrep** inside Claude Code. Very impressed by the retrieval, but not enough to pay extra for it.
* **Dec 2025 (Now):** I have switched fully to **Antigravity**. It came free with my Google One Pro subscription, and it was time to move on.

## The Constant Amidst the Chaos

Looking at that list, it feels chaotic. I changed my primary driver every few months.

But while the specific *tool* kept changing, my *process* didn't.

Whether I was in Cursor, a CLI, or Antigravity, the work was always about:

1. **Markdown for Intent:** Expressing exactly what I wanted in clear, written documents.
2. **Research & Planning:** asking the AI to generate a plan before writing a single line of code.
3. **Flexible Infrastructure:** Keeping my repo structure standard so any agent could pick it up.

I expect 2026 to be the same. The models will leapfrog each other, the tools will pivot, and I will probably switch IDEs two or three more times.

If you want to be "AI-Native" right now, you can't get too comfortable. You have to be ready to pack up your context and move to the next tool the moment it offers a better way to work.
